## What is DCO?

See `git help commit`:

```
-s, --signoff
    Add Signed-off-by line by the committer at the end of the commit log
    message. The meaning of a signoff depends on the project, but it typically
    certifies that committer has the rights to submit this work under the same
    license and agrees to a Developer Certificate of Origin (see
    http://developercertificate.org/ for more information).
```
